# -Face-Recognition-with-CNN
üöÄ Project Description: Face Recognition with CNN

In this project, I developed a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to perform face recognition. The goal was to accurately identify individuals from images using machine learning techniques.

üîç Key Components and Technologies:

Deep Learning: Implemented a CNN architecture using TensorFlow and Keras to train a face recognition model.
Data Preprocessing: Conducted data preprocessing techniques such as image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model performance.
Model Training: Trained the CNN model on a dataset of facial images to learn features and patterns associated with different individuals.
Evaluation and Testing: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Tested the model on unseen data to assess generalization ability.
Deployment: Deployed the trained model to make predictions on new images and perform real-time face recognition tasks.
üìà Achievements:

Achieved high accuracy in face recognition tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed model.
Implemented scalable and efficient solutions for real-time face recognition applications.
üíº Implications and Applications:

This project has significant implications in various domains such as security, surveillance, access control, and personalized user experiences.
The developed face recognition system can be integrated into security systems, attendance management systems, and identity verification applications.
üåü Future Enhancements:

Plan to explore advanced techniques such as transfer learning, ensemble methods, and deep metric learning to further improve model performance.
Aim to deploy the face recognition system in real-world scenarios and evaluate its effectiveness in practical applications.
